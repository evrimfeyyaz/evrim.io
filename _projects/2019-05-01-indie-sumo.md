![Indie Sumo](/public/projects/indie-sumo.jpg){: .post__image-left }

At one point, I got interested in solo entrepreneurship and bootstrapping, and while I was researching who to follow and what websites to visit, I realized that this information could be useful to others too, so I ended up creating a website to showcase what I found. You can [visit Indie Sumo here](https://www.indiesumo.com/).

I wrote this website in Rails, you can [view the codebase of IndieSumo on GitHub](https://github.com/evrimfeyyaz/indie-sumo).
