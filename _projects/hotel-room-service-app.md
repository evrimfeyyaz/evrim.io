As part of my previous startup, [Automated Hotel](/projects/automated-hotel), I developed a proof-of-concept app for The K Hotel
in Bahrain that would allow their guests to order room service and get information about The K Hotel from their mobile phones.

The application was developed in Swift for the iOS platform.
